# Preview Locally

Once you have [created a release](https://docs.shorebird.dev/code-push/release), you can preview your
release on an Android device, Android emulator, or iOS device using the `shorebird preview` command.

```

shorebird preview
```

This will download the release artifacts for the selected app release version, install the app on the selected device, and start the application.
